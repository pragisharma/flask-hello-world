# Tino Class Rank 

This is linked with a Vercel domain; resource: [https://flask3-python-template.vercel.app/]

A fun project which ranks different classes @ Cupertino High School!

## How it Works

This project utilizes Flask + HTML.
_This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Flask to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions._
